by Robel Arega

## Overview and Origin

- Name of company:

  - _Coinbase_

- When was the company incorporated?

  - _2012_

- Who are the founders of the company?

  - _Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam_

- How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

  - _Coinbase wanted to make Bitcoin accessable to anyone, anywhere at anytime. They have quickly become the leading mainstream cryptocurrency exchange in the United States._

- How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

  - _In the Spring of 2013, Coinbase received a Series A investment from Union Square Venture, founded by Fred Wilson and Brad Burnham (early investors into Twitter, Etsy, Tumblr and Kickstarter). Coinbase recieved a $5 million dollars from USV._

  - _Later that same year they received an additional $25 million in a Series B round of investments from Adreessen Horowitz, USV, and Ribbit Capital._

## Business Activities:

- What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

  - _Coinbase has made cryptocurrecy accessable to the fair-wether crypto investor. Someone who doesn't really understand what Bitcoin is, but wants to get involved. Their easy to use interface, and simple banking tools, make crypto buying and selling a breeze._

- Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
  What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

  - _The intended customer has always been the person who wants an easy way to invest in Bitcoin, now all crypto. Someone who doesn't want to go through the hassle of creating or buying their own wallet. Something simple._

  - _Their market size is huge, and as of 2020, Coinbase has over 35 million users in over 100 countries._

- Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

  - _Some interesing technologies Coinbase is implementing include:_

    - NGINX: This is an HTTP and reverse proxy server - According to Netcraft NGINX sreved 30.46% of the top million busiest sites in Jan 2018

    - Ruby: A dynamic, interpreted, opensource programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity

    - Google Analytics: Measures the advertising ROI as well as Flash, video and social networkignn sites and applications

    - BlockScore: An identity verification and anti-fraud solution - verifying customers identities

## Landscape:

- What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

  - _Coinbase is firmly in the cryptocurrency space. Since it is in the crypto space, it joins the slew of companies interupting the way people handle their own money._

- What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

  - _The major trends and innovations of cryptocurrency in the last 5-10 years have been astounding. Bitcoin has taken cryptocurrency from the obscure hedge to a deflating dollar to the mainstream. With all the applications of Blockchain from servicing underserviced peoples of the world to fixing the electoral process, the limits are endless._

- What are the other major companies in this domain?

  - _Some of Coinbase's biggest competitors are definitley Binance and Kraken. While there are a few other companies offering P2P lending like Celcius offering almost 10% APR on money sitting in curtain cryptoassets (DAI)._

## Results

- What has been the business impact of this company so far?

  - _Coinbase has introduced the casual investor to cryptocurrency in a straight forward intuitive way._

- What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

  - _The core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success would have to be users and how much money they're holding for those users. Based on 2020 metrics, Coinbase has over 35 million users in over 100 countries. So.. pretty good._

- How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

  - _Coinbases biggest competitor is Binance who in 2020 counted 15 million users._

## Recommendations

- If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

  - _I would advise Coinbase to continue and even extend their crypto education offering. Right now there are otpions for people with Coinbase accounts to receive altcoins for just taking quick class. This gets people excited about the possibilities of cryptocurrency and also has Coinbase as the face of their first interaction with cryptocurrency - thus creating a customer._

  - _Another suggestion would be to offer more options to earn extra crypto to the crypto sittin in users accounts at a higher interest rate._

- Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

  - _I think this will bring more users to Coinbase. Since most people invested into cryptocurrencies are already in the market, offering something like P2P lending would bring more people to Coinbase's platform._

- What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

  - _This additional product of more education would involve little to no additional technological advaces, just do more. The peer-to-peer lending or even business-to-business lending could gain a great deal from Blockchain technologies to get money to people faster and more secure._

- Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

  - _Blockchain would ensure through a series of verifications the money sent out to the people lending gets to them, and on the other end, doesn't ensure the money is paid back, but the money borrowed will be billed to the correct person_
